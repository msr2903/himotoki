{"id":"himotoki-nvuf","title":"Conjugation chain drops auxiliary verb labels when suffix is conjugated","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen a compound word contains a te-form auxiliary verb (しまう, いる, おく, いく, くれる, もらう, くる, ある, とく) that is itself conjugated further (e.g., past tense), the auxiliary verb name DISAPPEARS from the conjugation chain display. Only the conjugation type of the auxiliary is shown.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `himotoki/output.py` `_get_compound_display()` (line ~1686), when merging a suffix component's conjugation sub-chain, lines starting with `←` (root reading) are SKIPPED:\n\n```python\nif stripped.startswith(\"←\"):\n    # Skip auxiliary verb root lines\n    continue\n```\n\nThis removes the auxiliary verb identity.

{"id":"himotoki-sxvr","title":"Feature: conjugation breakdown tree in default output","description":"## Summary\n\nAdd a conjugation breakdown tree to himotoki's default text output. When a word is conjugated (via DB conjugation chains or suffix compounds), show a step-by-step derivation tree with box-drawing characters, including the conjugation suffix and an English gloss at each step.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, conjugation info is shown as a flat bracket notation:\n```\n[ Conjugation: [v1] Past (~ta) Negative Plain\n  食べる【たべる】 ]\n```\n\nThis doesn't show intermediate steps for multi-step conjugations like 食べられなかった (eaten + potential + negative + past). The user wants a tree:\n\n```\n食べられなかった【たべられなかった】 (Ichidan verb) \u003c- 食べる【たべる】\n  └─ passive/potential (られる): is done/can do\n       └─ negative (ない): not\n            └─ past (た): did\n```\n\n## Design Decisions (confirmed by user)\n\n1. **Output mode**: Add to DEFAULT output (always shown for conjugated words)\n2. **Scope**: Cover BOTH DB conjugation chains AND suffix compounds\n3. **English glosses**: Include per-step English descriptions (e.g., \"can do\", \"not\", \"did\")\n\n## Two Conjugation Mechanisms\n\n### 1. DB Conjugation Chains (Conjugation.via)\n\nUsed for single inflected words like 食べられなかった. The `Conjugation` table has:\n- `seq`: The conjugated entry\n- `from_seq`: The root/dictionary entry\n- `via`: Intermediate seq for secondary conjugations (e.g., passive form seq for passive+negative)\n\nThe `ConjProp` table stores type/neg/fml per conjugation step. The `ConjSourceReading` table maps conjugated text to source text at each step.\n\nKey code path:\n- `himotoki/lookup.py` L822-892: `get_conj_data()` - fetches ConjData objects\n- `himotoki/lookup.py` L1951-1999: `_get_original_text_data_recursive()` - follows via chains (already walks the tree for scoring, but discards intermediate steps)\n- `himotoki/db/models.py` L225-253: Conjugation model with `via` field\n\n### 2. Suffix Compounds (CompoundWord.words)\n\nUsed for verb+suffix combinations like 食べている (eat + progressive). The `CompoundWord` class holds:\n- `primary`: The main word (食べ)\n- `words`: List of all component `WordMatch` objects [食べ, て, いる]\n\nKey code path:\n- `himotoki/lookup.py` L239-352: CompoundWord class\n- `himotoki/output.py` L832-935: word_info_from_segment() for CompoundWord case\n- `WordInfo.components`: List of component WordInfo objects (already populated)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Add CONJ_STEP_GLOSSES to constants.py\n\nAdd English glosses for each conjugation type:\n```python\nCONJ_STEP_GLOSSES = {\n    CONJ_NON_PAST: \"does/is\",\n    CONJ_PAST: \"did\",\n    CONJ_TE: \"and/then\",\n    CONJ_PROVISIONAL: \"if\",\n    CONJ_POTENTIAL: \"can do\",\n    CONJ_PASSIVE: \"is done (to)\",\n    CONJ_CAUSATIVE: \"makes do\",\n    CONJ_CAUSATIVE_PASSIVE: \"is made to do\",\n    CONJ_VOLITIONAL: \"let's/will\",\n    CONJ_IMPERATIVE: \"do!\",\n    CONJ_CONDITIONAL: \"if/when\",\n    CONJ_ALTERNATIVE: \"doing things like\",\n    CONJ_CONTINUATIVE: \"and (stem)\",\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add ConjStep dataclass to output.py\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass ConjStep:\n    conj_type: str       # e.g., \"Passive\"\n    suffix: str          # e.g., \"られる\"\n    gloss: str           # e.g., \"is done/can do\"\n    neg: bool = False\n    fml: bool = False\n```\n\n### Step 3: New function build_conj_chain() in output.py\n\nWalk the `Conjugation.via` chain to produce a list of `ConjStep` objects for DB-conjugated words. This is the KEY new logic:\n\n1. Start with the word's conjugation IDs\n2. Query `Conjugation` table -\u003e get `ConjProp` (type) and `ConjSourceReading` (suffix text)\n3. If `via` is not None, recursively query `Conjugation` where `seq = via` to get intermediate steps\n4. Build ordered list of ConjStep from root outward\n\nReference: `_get_original_text_data_recursive()` at lookup.py L1951 already walks via chains but only returns text data. The new function needs to capture ConjProp at each step.\n\n### Step 4: New function build_compound_steps() in output.py\n\nFor suffix compounds, iterate `WordInfo.components` and create ConjStep for each suffix component (everything after the primary word).\n\n### Step 5: New function format_conj_breakdown() in output.py\n\nRender the list of ConjSteps as a tree with box-drawing characters:\n```\n  └─ passive (られる): is done\n       └─ negative (ない): not\n            └─ past (た): did\n```\n\nEach level indents by 5 chars. Format: `└─ {type} ({suffix}): {gloss}`\nNegative/formal modifiers prepend to type: \"negative past\" instead of just \"past\".\n\n### Step 6: Add header line function\n\nFormat the header: `surface【reading】 (POS) \u003c- source【source_reading】`\nOnly shown when conjugation data exists.\n\n### Step 7: Integrate into format_word_info_text() in cli.py\n\nAfter the existing conjugation bracket output (or replacing it), call:\n```python\nbreakdown = build_conj_breakdown(session, wi)\nif breakdown:\n    lines.append(breakdown)\n```\n\n### Step 8: Integrate into segment_to_text() in output.py\n\nSame integration as cli.py's format_word_info_text().\n\n## Files to Change\n\n| File | What Changes |\n|------|-------------|\n| `himotoki/constants.py` L95+ | Add `CONJ_STEP_GLOSSES` dict |\n| `himotoki/output.py` L70+ | Add `ConjStep` dataclass |\n| `himotoki/output.py` L1570+ | Add `build_conj_chain()`, `build_compound_steps()`, `format_conj_breakdown()`, `build_conj_breakdown()` |\n| `himotoki/cli.py` L75-82 | Integrate breakdown into `format_word_info_text()` |\n| `himotoki/output.py` L1555-1565 | Integrate breakdown into `segment_to_text()` |\n| `tests/` | Add test for breakdown output |\n\n## How to Verify\n\n```bash\n# Test with conjugated verb\necho \"食べられなかった\" | python -m himotoki\n\n# Test with suffix compound\necho \"食べている\" | python -m himotoki\n\n# Test with polite past\necho \"行きました\" | python -m himotoki\n\n# Run tests\npytest tests/ -x --tb=short\n```\n\n## Expected Output Examples\n\n```\n食べられなかった【たべられなかった】 (Ichidan verb) \u003c- 食べる【たべる】\n  └─ passive/potential (られる): is done/can do\n       └─ negative (ない): not\n            └─ past (た): did\n\n行きました【いきました】 (Godan verb) \u003c- 行く【いく】\n  └─ polite (ます): polite\n       └─ past (た): did\n\n食べている【たべている】 (compound)\n  └─ 食べ: eat (te-form)\n       └─ て: connective\n            └─ いる: is doing (progressive)\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"michaelpersonal67@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T15:01:26.006178+09:00","created_by":"Michael Stefano Rioli","updated_at":"2026-02-07T15:49:32.259464+09:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T15:49:32.259464+09:00","close_reason":"Implemented conjugation breakdown tree","labels":["feature"]}
